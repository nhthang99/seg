        Base class for all engines. Your engine should subclass this class.
        Class Engine contains an Ignite Engine that controls running process over a dataset.
        Method _update is a function receiving the running Ignite Engine and the current batch in each iteration and returns data to be stored in the Ignite Engine's state.
        Parameters:
            dataset_name (str): dataset which engine run over.
            device (str): device on which model and tensor is allocated.
            max_epochs (int): number of epochs training process runs.
